## Overview

This project, the "Cook Time Calculator App," is a collaborative effort developed by our team to showcase the concept of parallel programming logic. The app is designed to calculate cooking times for a variety of dishes and recipes, taking into account dependencies and prerequisites.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** We implemented the frontend using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a popular React framework known for its performance and developer-friendly features.

- **Backend:** The backend of our application is powered by [Python](https://www.python.org/) with the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) framework. Flask's simplicity and flexibility made it an excellent choice for handling the server-side logic.

## Features

- **Cooking Time Calculation:** Our app allows users to input various dishes, each with a specified cooking time. It takes into account dependencies and prerequisites, ensuring that the cooking times are accurately calculated.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it a practical tool for kitchen enthusiasts.

- **Collaborative Development:** This project was a collaborative effort by a team of developers with a passion for technology and software. We worked together to implement the app's features and showcase the principles of parallel programming.
